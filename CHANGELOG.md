## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-02

### Changed — Instruction formatting

- Standardized Agent Powerups authoring guidance on YAML frontmatter plus pure Markdown bodies for durable agent instruction files.
- Converted shipped skill examples that used XML-like top-level section tags to Markdown headings.
- Added validation coverage to reject XML-like top-level section tags in `SKILL.md` files while preserving explicit delimiter and prompt-payload use cases.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added — Root skills

- Mirrored 41 plugin-bundled skills into the root `skills/` directory so default installs and catalog discovery expose the same reusable guidance as plugin bundles.
- Added catalog entries for the mirrored skills across agentic systems, codebase maintenance, data engineering, debugging diagnostics, dev vitals, documentation systems, machine learning ops, memory optimization, and quality gates.

### Changed — Catalog hygiene

- Kept ignored `worktree-session-manager` WIP assets out of the public catalog and shipped skills list until their executable workflow is release-ready.
