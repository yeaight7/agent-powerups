description: Turn a repeatable workflow from the current session into a reusable OMC skill draft
---

# Skillify

Use this skill when the current session uncovered a repeatable workflow that should become a reusable OMC skill.

## Goal
Capture a successful multi-step workflow as a concrete skill draft instead of rediscovering it later.

## Workflow
1. Identify the repeatable task the session accomplished.
2. Extract:
   - inputs
   - ordered steps
   - success criteria
   - constraints / pitfalls
   - best target location for the skill
3. Decide whether the workflow belongs as:
   - a repo built-in skill
   - a user/project learned skill
   - documentation only
4. When drafting a learned skill file, output a complete skill file that starts with YAML frontmatter.
   - Never emit plain markdown-only skill files.
   - Minimum frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: <skill-name>
     description: <one-line description>
     triggers:
       - <trigger-1>
       - <trigger-2>
     ---
     ```
   - Write learned/user/project skills to:
     - `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills/omc-learned/<skill-name>.md`
     - `.omc/skills/<skill-name>.md`
5. Draft the rest of the skill file with clear triggers, steps, and success criteria.
6. Point out anything still too fuzzy to encode safely.

## Rules
- Only capture workflows that are actually repeatable.
- Keep the skill practical and scoped.
- Prefer explicit success criteria over vague prose.
- If the workflow still has unresolved branching decisions, note them before drafting.

## Output
- Proposed skill name
- Target location
- Draft workflow structure
- Open questions, if any
